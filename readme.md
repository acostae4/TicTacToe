This is a TicTacToe game created for the Covalence JavaScript assignment. 

Requirements: 
In order for the game to work, you need to write JavaScript that will interact with your HTML elements. The requirements for the game are:

-Players can click on a cell in order to make a move.
-X is always the first player.
-After each move, the board is checked for a winner or a draw.
-If there is a winner or draw, show a message that announces the winner or declares a draw.
-Clicking the board when a game is over should reset the board so that a new game can be played.

Notes: 
-Slightly skewed away from the requirments and took a different path to create the game.
